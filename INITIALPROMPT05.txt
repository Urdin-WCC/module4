Neurowitch - Complete Modular Development Guide
Chapter 0: Common Information & Project Principles
0.1 Introduction
Welcome to the developyment guide for the "Neurowitch" project. This document details the modular architecture and technical specifications for building the application. The goal of this modular structure is to enable parallel and efficient development, where each developer or AI agent can focus on a specific module with self-contained instructions.
This Chapter 0 contains all the fundamental and common information that all developers must know before starting work on any module. The subsequent chapters (1-14) describe the specific modules. To work on a module (e.g., Module 5: Blog), you will need to read this Chapter 0 and the corresponding module chapter (Chapter 5).
0.2 Project Overview
Neurowitch is a complete, responsive, and accessible web application featuring an administration panel for managing content (blog, portfolio, static pages), SEO, appearance (theming), and site statistics. It consists of a publicly accessible front-end and an administration panel protected by role-based authentication.
0.3 Mandatory Tech Stack
All development must exclusively use the following technology stack to ensure compatibility:
Primary Framework: Next.js (version 14+ with App Router)
Language: TypeScript
UI Library: React (version 18+)
Database: MySQL (version 5.7+)
ORM: Prisma
CSS Styling: Tailwind CSS
Authentication: Next-Auth.js (v5+)
Form Handling: React Hook Form
UI Components (Recommended): Shadcn/ui (installed and configured in the base project)
State Management (Client-side): Zustand (preferred) or React Context API
HTML Editor: React Quill or Tiptap
File Upload (UI): React Dropzone
Charts: Recharts
Package Manager: npm or yarn
0.4 Credentials & Initial Setup
Database (MySQL):
Connection URL (to be configured in /.env as DATABASE_URL for Prisma):
DATABASE_URL=mysql://u643065128_masterx:sql93893M@srv1789.hstgr.io:3306/u643065128_neurox


Default Users (to be created in the initial DB seed script):
Role master: name: "master", login: "master@app.com", password: "12345.Abcd"
Role admin: name: "admin", login: "admin@app.com", password: "12345.Abcd"
Role editor: name: "editor", login: "editor@app.com", password: "12345.Abcd"
Role collaborator: name: "collaborator", login: "collaborator@app.com", password: "12345.Abcd"
(Note: Passwords must be stored hashed in the DB using bcrypt)
Role Hierarchy (Strict):
master > admin > editor > collaborator
A user can only view/manage users and content at their level or lower, as specified in each module. Access to admin panel sections/features must be strictly restricted by role.
0.5 General Principles & Mandatory Requirements
All modules must adhere to the following principles:
Responsiveness & Accessibility: All interfaces (public and admin) must be fully responsive and follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA). Use Tailwind CSS for this.
No Public Signup: The application does not allow public user registration. Users are created from the admin panel.
NO Browser Local Storage: Under no circumstances should localStorage or sessionStorage be used for storing sensitive information or application state. Use secure cookies (managed by Next-Auth for session) or server/URL state.
Clean & Commented Code: Write clear, well-structured, and maintainable TypeScript code. Comment complex logic, public functions, and data types (use TSDoc).
Documentation: Maintain necessary documentation (TSDoc, comments) to understand the module's functionality.
Robustness & Reliability: Use the tech stack tools appropriately. Implement error handling (try/catch, UI error states). Do not simulate, remove, hide, or simplify described features without authorization.
Security: Implement basic security measures: input validation in API routes, CSRF protection (Next-Auth helps), XSS protection (React helps, be careful with dangerouslySetInnerHTML), security header configuration, route/API protection by role. Prevent Path Traversal in file handling. Hash passwords.
Performance: Optimize public page load times (Next.js SSR/SSG), image loading (use next/image component), and DB queries (Prisma).
Consistency: Follow the naming and structure conventions defined in this chapter. Use components and utilities from the Core_Module whenever possible.
Error Handling: Display clear and user-friendly error messages when something fails (both client-side and server-side validations).
Backups: (Responsibility of the project manager) Perform regular database backups.
Application Language: IMPORTANT: While these development instructions are in English, the final application's user-facing interface (UI text, labels, messages, content) MUST be in Spanish. Ensure all user-visible text implemented in the components is in Spanish.
0.6 Recommended Folder Structure (Next.js App Router)

0.7 Core Module Interface Summary (Module 1 Exports)
The Core_Module (Chapter 1) will establish the foundation and provide the following key tools and functionalities that other modules must use:
Database Access: Via the singleton Prisma client exported from lib/prisma.ts. All DB interactions must use this typed client.
Authentication & Session (Next-Auth.js):
signIn, signOut functions for login/logout.
useSession hook or auth() function (Server Components) to get current user session data (including role).
Middleware (middleware.ts) configured to protect admin routes (/admin/**).
Helpers/Hooks (in lib/auth.ts or lib/hooks/) to check specific user roles.
ImageUploader Component (components/core/ImageUploader.tsx): Reusable React component for uploading/selecting images. Handles upload to /public/uploads/images via an internal API route, validation, and returns the public image URL. Supports single and multiple uploads.
HtmlEditor Component (components/core/HtmlEditor.tsx): Reusable React component (based on React Quill or Tiptap) for editing HTML content.
generateSlug(title: string): string Function (lib/utils.ts): Utility to generate URL-friendly slugs from titles.
logAdminAction(...) Function (lib/stats.ts): Function to log important actions performed in the admin panel (see Chapter 13).
Global Configuration: Functions (in lib/config.ts or similar) to read/write global settings stored in the database (e.g., GlobalConfig model in Prisma).
0.8 Version Control with Git

All development must use Git for version control. Each module should be initialized as a Git repository and commits should be made frequently with descriptive messages.

**Git Configuration:**
- Repository: Local repository for each module
- User Configuration:
  - Email: neurowitch@example.com
  - Name: Neurowitch Developer

**Basic Git Commands:**
- Initialize repository: `git init`
- Configure user (repository level):
  - `git config user.email "neurowitch@example.com"`
  - `git config user.name "Neurowitch Developer"`
- Stage changes: `git add .`
- Commit changes: `git commit -m "Descriptive message about changes"`
- View status: `git status`
- View commit history: `git log`

**Commit Message Guidelines:**
- Use clear, descriptive messages that explain what changes were made
- Start with a verb in imperative form (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- For complex changes, add more details in the commit body

**Branching Strategy:**
- `master` or `main`: Stable, production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name`: For new features
- `fix/issue-name`: For bug fixes

0.9 Basic Workflow
Install Dependencies: npm install (or yarn install).
Run Migrations: npx prisma migrate dev (during development to create/update DB).
Generate Prisma Client: npx prisma generate (automatic with migrate dev, but useful if schema.prisma changes).
Run Development Server: npm run dev (or yarn dev).

Note: If possible, implement a simple test to confirm functionality of the module, the test should be non-destructive. If implementing the test complicates the development too much, ignore this note.




Chapter 5: Blog_Module (Blog Management and Display)
(Content adapted from previous Spanish Document 5)
Objective: Implement all blog-related functionality: CRUD in admin panel and public site display.
Specific Technology: Next.js (App Router, API Routes, SSR/SSG/Server Components), React, TypeScript, Prisma (via Core), Tailwind CSS, React Hook Form.
Detailed Responsibilities:
1.	Data Model (Prisma Schema):
○	Ensure schema.prisma (in Core) contains Post, Category, Tag models with all required fields and relations to User.
2.	Admin Panel Blog Management [collaborator]:
○	Create pages: app/(admin)/admin/blog/page.tsx (list), new/page.tsx, edit/[id]/page.tsx. Use AdminLayout. UI text (titles, labels, buttons) in Spanish.
○	List: Client component using useSWR/useQuery to fetch from API route /api/blog (GET, with pagination/filters/search). Display in table. Edit/Delete buttons (call API DELETE /api/blog/[id]) with role logic [collaborator+].
○	Create/Edit: Form (react-hook-form). Use Core ImageUploader, HtmlEditor. Status logic [collaborator] vs [editor+]. Call API route /api/blog (POST) or /api/blog/[id] (PUT) to save via Prisma. Validate roles in API.
3.	Admin Panel Blog Configuration [admin]:
○	Create page app/(admin)/admin/settings/blog/page.tsx. Use AdminLayout. Access [admin]. UI text in Spanish.
○	Form (react-hook-form) for blog options.
○	Call API route (/api/settings/blog) to save to GlobalConfig (Prisma via Core). Protect API [admin].
4.	Public Blog Site:
○	Create public routes under app/(public)/blog/:
■	page.tsx (List): Use Server Components or generateStaticParams+page to fetch published posts (Prisma). Apply config (pagination, sidebar). UI text (e.g., "Leer más") in Spanish.
■	[slug]/page.tsx (Detail): Use Server Components or generateStaticParams+page to fetch by slug. Render content. UI text (e.g., author, date format) in Spanish.
■	search/page.tsx (Search): Page using query param q to search via Prisma. UI text in Spanish.
■	category/[slug]/page.tsx, tag/[slug]/page.tsx: Filter posts. UI text in Spanish.
○	Use PublicLayout.
5.	API Routes:
○	Define API routes under app/api/blog/:
■	route.ts (GET for list with filters/pagination, POST for create).
■	[id]/route.ts (GET for detail, PUT for update, DELETE for delete).
■	latest/route.ts (GET for widget).
○	Protect routes appropriately (public GETs, role-protected POST/PUT/DELETE). Use Prisma (via Core). Call Core's logAdminAction on writes.
Dependencies: Core_Module (Auth, DB/Prisma, Utilities, Components, logAdminAction), UI_Framework_Module (Layouts).
Interactions:
●	Defines/uses Prisma models.
●	Defines blog admin pages and API routes.
●	API routes use Prisma, validate roles, log actions.
●	Uses Core components/utilities.
●	Uses Layouts.
●	Public pages use Next.js data fetching with Prisma.
●	Provides API for WidgetLatestPosts.
Instructions for Agent: "Implement the Blog_Module (Module 5) using Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Prisma (via Core), Tailwind CSS. Define/ensure Post, Category, Tag models in schema.prisma. Create CRUD [collaborator+, restrictions] in /admin/blog/... pages (use react-hook-form, Core Components, useSWR/useQuery). Create config page /admin/settings/blog [admin]. Create necessary API routes under /api/blog/ (public/protected GETs, role-protected POST/PUT/DELETE) using Prisma and calling logAdminAction. Implement public views /blog/... (list, detail, search, category) using Server Components or SSG/SSR for Prisma fetching. Use Layouts and Core services. All user-facing text (admin UI and public site) must be in Spanish."
